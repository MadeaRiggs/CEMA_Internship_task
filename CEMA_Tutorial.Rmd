## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#vector of the sequence of numericals 1 to 100, as an object
dat2 <- seq(1,100)
dat2
```


```{r cars}
#creatng an object- anything that takes a value
dat1 <- read.csv("https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/binary.csv")
head(dat1)
```
```{r}
#to create a vector in an object-array
dat3 <- c(2,3,6,15)
dat3
```
```{r}
#to add a constant to each member of the array
dat3 + 8
```
```{r}
#to assign characters to the object
dat4 <- c("two","three","six","fifteen")
dat4
```
```{r}
#to create a dataframe
dat5 <- data.frame(dat4,dat3)
dat5
```

## Functions in R
```{r}
print(mean(dat3))
#to get standard deviation
print(sd(dat3))
```
## Data Types
```{r}
#Doubles represent continuous variables e.g weight
x <- c(3.14,5.7)
#to confirm if it is a Double
is.double(x)
```
```{r}
#Integers are natural numbers eg counting variables
nrhinos <- as.integer(88)
typeof(nrhinos)

nrhinos <- 88.0
is.integer(nrhinos)
```
```{r}
#Logical takes the values FALSE or TRUE
g <- 99
h <- g < 88
h
```
```{r}
#Characters represent a collection of characters between double quotes
rstudents <- c("Elk","Dun","Sar","Mik")
rstudents
```
```{r}
#Factor - represents categorical data - the value range of which is a collection of codes, eg sex - male/female, education - informal/formal, infection status - positive/negative ..etc. 

#Individual code of the factor is called Level of the factor

educ <- factor(c("primary","secondary","primary","university","no education","secondary"))
educ
```
## Data Importation
```{r}
#to check available datasets
data()
```

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/msberends/AMR")

```

```{r}
#to import the WHONET dataset
library(AMR)
```
```{r}
data(WHONET)
?WHONET
head(WHONET,4)
```
```{r}
#importing external files that you first need to upload
#mydata1 <- read.csv(file.choose(), header=TRUE)

#read.csv - is the function that instructs R that the data is saved as a .csv format, and use:

#file.choose - opens a browser window enabling you to locate where the file is sitted

#header=TRUE - instructs R to take the first row to contain the variable names

#Text files - imported much the same way as above, using the function read.table, check ?read.table 

#Excel files you will need the package xlsReadWrite and you will use the functions read.xls and write.xls

#Databases: uses the following packages

#RODBC - provide an interface for ODBC compliant databases (eg. MS Access, MS SQLServer, Oracle)

#RMySQL - provide an interface to a MySQL database

#RSQLite - interface with SQLite  
```
```{r}
#to import from other statistical softwares e.g S, SAS, Epi info, Stata, SPSS, dBaseâ€¦etc 
install.packages("foreign")
library(foreign)
```
## Dereferencing
```{r}
#Dereferencing means getting a specific part of an object. 
a1 <- seq(from=11, to=53, by=3)
a1
```
```{r}
#to get specific elements of the array
a1[c(3,6)]
```
```{r}
#to create a matrix
a2 <- matrix(a1, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
a2
```
```{r}
a3 <- matrix(a1, ncol=2, byrow=FALSE)
a3
```
```{r}
# selecting the 2nd column of the matrix
a2[,2]

# selecting the 3rd row of the matrix
a2[3,]
```
```{r}
a4 <- data.frame(a2)
a4
```
```{r}
# selecting column 3
# variables (columns) can be addressed using the dollar sign $
a4$X3
```
```{r}
#to get the names of the columns of dataframe
names(a4)

#number of rows
nrow(a4)

#number of columns
ncol(a4)

#dimensions of the dataframe
dim(a4)

#length of a column use
length(a4$X2)
```
```{r}
#longitudinal cohort study (Infectious Diseases of East African Livestock - IDEAL study) investigating the infection experiences of 548 calves during their first year of life.

ideal1 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cema-uonbi/R_course/main/ideal1.csv")
ideal2 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cema-uonbi/R_course/main/ideal2.csv")
```
```{r}
head(ideal1, 5)
```
```{r}
# dimensions number of rows and columns
print(dim(ideal1))
print(dim(ideal2))
```
```{r}
## Attributes of the dataset
attributes(ideal1) 
```
```{r}
# summary of the dataset
summary(ideal1)
```
```{r}
# description of the variables
print(typeof(ideal1$CalfSex))
print(typeof(ideal1$sublocation))
```
```{r}
#to change CalfSex from integer to factor and recode the values from 1 to Male and 2 to Female
ideal1$CalfSex <- factor(ideal1$CalfSex)
is.factor(ideal1$CalfSex)
```
```{r}
# determmine levels of factor calfsex
# recode to ``Male" and ``Female"

levels(ideal1$CalfSex)
```
```{r}
# recode variable CalfSex
# first create a new variable called CalfSex1
# assign it values of CalfSex
ideal1$CalfSex1 <- ideal1$CalfSex
table(ideal1$CalfSex1)
```
```{r}
ideal1$CalfSex1 <- ifelse(ideal1$CalfSex1==1,"Male","Female")
table(ideal1$CalfSex1)
```
```{r}
#check consistency of the two columns with CalfSex data

table(ideal1$CalfSex,ideal1$CalfSex1)
```
```{r}
# check consistency of the two columns with CalfSex data
table(ideal1$CalfSex,ideal1$CalfSex1)
```
## Merging Data
```{r}
##CalfID is the unique identifier we will use to combine the two datasets
ideal3 <- merge(ideal1,ideal2,by.x="CalfID",by.y="CalfID", all.x=T)
dim(ideal3)
```
```{r}
head(ideal3,4)
```
# Subsetting Data
```{r}
#if we wanted data from only one sublocation - Kidera
idealkidera <- subset(ideal3, ideal3$sublocation=="Kidera")
table(idealkidera$sublocation)
```
```{r}
#data on only females from Kidera
idealkideraF <- subset(ideal3, ideal3$sublocation=="Kidera" & 
                         ideal3$CalfSex1=="female")
head(idealkideraF, 5)
```
```{r}
install.packages("haven")
```
```{r}
install.packages("stringr")
```
```{r}
#change the CADOB column in ideal 1 into a date
ideal1$CADOB <- as.Date(ideal1$CADOB)
#to check if it is adate column
class(ideal1$CADOB)
#it will return Double since dates in R are internally stored as the number of days 
typeof(ideal1$CADOB)
```
```{r}
#change the VisitDate column into ideal 2 into a date
ideal2$VisitDate <- as.Date(ideal2$VisitDate)
class(ideal2$VisitDate)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)

ideal1<- ideal1 %>% 
  mutate(CalfSex=recode(CalfSex, "1"="Male", "2"="Female")) %>%
  mutate()
head(ideal1)
```
```{r}
#to recode the Reasonsloss column
ideal1 <- ideal1 %>%
  mutate(ReasonsLoss= recode(ReasonsLoss, "6"= "owner declined", "7"= "Death", "12"= "Relocation", "18"= "Given out")) %>%
  mutate()
head(ideal1)
```
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Unpivot the selected columns in 'ideal2' and store the result in 'ideal2a'
ideal2a <- ideal2 %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(ManualPCV, Theileria.spp., ELISA_mutans, ELISA_parva, Q.Strongyle.eggs),
               names_to = "Variable",
               values_to = "Value")

# Display the first few rows of 'ideal2a'
head(ideal2a)

#the "names_to" parameter to create a new column named 'Variable' to store the original column names
#the "values_to" parameter to create a new column named 'Value' to store the corresponding values.

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
